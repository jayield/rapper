DataMapper in rap for domain model

Rapper is a Reactive Data Mapper library for Java, which provides an implementation of a Data Mapper for a domain entity. 
This implementations follows the principles stated by Martin Fowler in [[Fowler, 2002]][#Fowler2002] about Object-Relational Behavioral 
and Data Source Architectural Patterns, but applied to a reactive approach. Thus the Rapper API is asynchronous and the data mapper effects 
are strongly typed in Promises [[Friedman and Wise, 1976]][#FriedmanAndWise1976].

The Rapper implementation use the following design patterns: 

* [Unit of Work](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html)
* [Data Mapper](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html)
* [Identity Map](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/identityMap.html)
* etc…

### Structure
- `MapperRegistry` is the class to aim for when we want to manipulate the data. This static class supplies `DataRepository` instances for data manipulation.

- Each `DataRepository` will have an **Identity Map**, which holds the recents objects read/altered from the DB.

- `DataRepository` is a proxy to a `DataMapper`. In queries, it will verify if the object is already in the Identity Map and return it, or call 
`DataMapper` to obtain it.

- The objects in the **Identity Map** are immutable, to change the data, a new immutable object will be created to replace the one in the map. The replacement 
 will only happen if the commit is successful.
 
- There will be one `UnitOfWork` for each request handled by a `DataRepository`, so each one will know what has been changed and 
what needs to be written to the DB. When the request is fully processed by `DataRepository`, it will inform `UnitOfWork` to write all the changes made.

- There will be a **connection pool** to establish links with the DB. This allows the re-use of connections already made, avoiding the 
creation of multiple connections.

- The **Identity Map** implements a LRU cache. They have a limit of what they can hold in memory, and when it reaches the limit, 
they will delete the least-read elements.
 
- A `DomainObject` may contain a `CompletableFuture<List<DomainObject>>` as a reference to another table. The field holding it, must be annotated with 
<code>@ColumnName</code>, in which is passed `foreignName` as the name of the column in the referenced table where the ID of the `DomainObject` 
takes place, the `table` in case of N-N relation and the `externalName` which is the name of the column in the referenced table 
where the ID of the external `DomainObject` takes place. `externalName` is only needed when `table` is given.
 
### Rules
- You must create an environment variable to connect to the DB. The environment variable must have the following format:

Name:

```sh
DB_CONNECTION_STRING
```

Value:

```sh
servername;database;user;password
```

- All domain objects must implement interface <code>DomainObject</code>.

- The domain object classes must have the same name as respective DB table, same for the fields/rows.

- The field corresponding to the primary key must have the annotation <code>@Id</code> and if it's auto-generated by the DB, 
`isIdentity()` must return true. If it is a composed key it is needed to create a class that contains the keys and respective 
names, the domain object must have field of that class and mark it with the annotation <code>@EmbeddedId</code>.

- A `DomainObject` and the field annotated with <code>@EmbeddedId</code> must have a 0 arguments constructor.

- Each `DomainObject` must have a `version` field. This will be used to successful synchronise the in-memory data and DB as it will only allow
writes in the DB, if the `DomainObject`'s `version` that is being written exists on it.
